# Lightwalker Success Metrics Definition
## MVP Launch Criteria & Performance Benchmarks

**Project Manager Deliverable**  
**Date**: July 25, 2025  
**Building on**: Sprint 1 monitoring patterns and Lightwalker research  
**Purpose**: Define measurable success criteria for MVP launch decision

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines comprehensive success metrics for Lightwalker MVP that build upon Sprint 1's proven monitoring foundation while establishing new benchmarks for template personality engagement, copying behavior motivation, and process-focused transformation.

**Success Philosophy**: Measure the process (copying activity) rather than outcomes (life transformation)  
**Integration Strategy**: Extend Sprint 1 analytics to include Lightwalker-specific engagement patterns  
**Launch Decision**: Clear quantitative and qualitative criteria for MVP release
