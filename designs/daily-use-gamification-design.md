# Lightwalker Daily Use Gamification Design Specification

## Project Overview

**Design Goal**: Transform the Lightwalker Daily Use page into an engaging, game-inspired interface that makes habit formation feel like playing an immersive RPG while maintaining the core principle of observational learning.

**Core Concept**: Users copy their AI Lightwalker's daily actions to develop desired personality traits through a game-like inventory system inspired by Escape from Tarkov's container design and RPG progression mechanics.
