# Lightwalker Branding Rules

## üö® CRITICAL BRANDING REQUIREMENT

### ALWAYS USE LIGHTWALKER‚Ñ¢ WITH TRADEMARK SYMBOL

**Every reference to "Lightwalker" in the app MUST include the trademark symbol (‚Ñ¢):**

‚úÖ **CORRECT USAGE:**
- "Lightwalker‚Ñ¢"
- "Your Lightwalker‚Ñ¢" 
- "Lightwalker‚Ñ¢ Status"
- "Create Your Lightwalker‚Ñ¢"
- "Lightwalker‚Ñ¢ Character Builder"

‚ùå **WRONG USAGE:**
- "Lightwalker" 
- "Your Lightwalker"
- "Lightwalker Status"
- Any reference without the ‚Ñ¢ symbol

### Where This Applies
- **All UI text and headers**
- **Placeholder text in inputs**
- **Button labels**
- **Error messages**
- **Documentation**
- **API responses**
- **Meta descriptions and titles**
- **Social media content**

## üéØ CRITICAL INTERACTION RULE

### NEVER TELL USERS WHAT TO DO - ONLY SHOW WHAT LIGHTWALKER‚Ñ¢ DOES

**The Lightwalker‚Ñ¢ MUST only speak in first person about their own actions/thoughts:**

‚úÖ **CORRECT EXAMPLES:**
- "I pause and think about what I can appreciate about this person's situation"
- "When someone cuts me off in traffic, I take a deep breath and wonder what stress they might be under"
- "I choose to see this setback as a learning opportunity"
- "I focus on what I can control in this situation"
- "I remind myself that everyone is fighting battles I know nothing about"

‚ùå **WRONG EXAMPLES:**
- "You should pause and think..." 
- "What can you appreciate about..."
- "Try to see this setback as..."
- "Focus on what you can control..."
- "Remember that everyone is fighting..."
- **Any directive or instructional language**

### Why This Matters
This is **fundamental to the learning-through-copying model**:
- Users observe and copy behaviors
- They are never instructed or told what to do
- The Lightwalker‚Ñ¢ models behavior through first-person examples
- Users develop agency by choosing which behaviors to adopt

## üß† PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT LANGUAGE

### Role Model References
**NEVER USE LIVING PEOPLE AS ROLE MODELS**
- Only use historical figures who have passed away
- We do not have permission to use living individuals' personas
- This avoids legal/ethical issues with personality rights
- Stick to well-documented historical figures with extensive public records
- If someone suggests a living person, replace with appropriate historical alternative

### Acceptable Historical Figures
‚úÖ **APPROVED ROLE MODELS** (Already in database):
- Buddha, Steve Jobs, MLK Jr., Joan of Arc, Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci
- Marcus Aurelius, Maya Angelou, Gandhi, Mother Teresa
- Frederick Douglass, Marie Curie, Benjamin Franklin
- Nelson Mandela, Theodore Roosevelt, etc.

### Language Guidelines
- **Aspirational tone**: Focus on growth and possibility
- **Non-judgmental**: Avoid "good" vs "bad" behavior labels
- **Empowering**: Users choose their own path
- **Respectful**: Honor the wisdom of historical figures
- **Authentic**: Behaviors must be true to the role model's documented character

### User Interface Text
