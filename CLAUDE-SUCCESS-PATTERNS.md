## üêõ DEBUGGING PATTERNS - PROVEN TECHNIQUES

### Complex State Issues Debugging Pattern ‚úÖ
**Use when**: React state appears to update but visual changes don't occur
1. **Add useEffect logging** to track state changes: `useEffect(() => console.log('State changed:', state), [state])`
2. **Add try/catch** around all state updates with error logging
3. **Log before/after** state updates: `console.log('Before:', prev.length, 'After:', updated.length)`
4. **Simplify object creation** - start with minimal fields, add complexity gradually
5. **Check both logs AND visual results** - successful logs don't guarantee visual success
6. **Use TodoWrite tool** to track debugging progress systematically

### React Beautiful DND Issues Pattern ‚úÖ  
**Use when**: Drag/drop shows correct logs but doesn't work visually
1. **Check for duplicate event handlers** - React Beautiful DND + HTML5 drag can conflict
2. **Add state tracking** for drag operations: `draggedActivityId`, `isDropTarget`, etc.
3. **Use precise logging** at each step: drag start ‚Üí drag over ‚Üí drop ‚Üí state update ‚Üí render
4. **Prevent duplicate processing** with unique keys/timestamps
5. **Test time calculations separately** from visual rendering
6. **Ensure React Strict Mode is disabled** for React Beautiful DND compatibility

### Timeline/Positioning Bugs Pattern ‚úÖ
**Use when**: Activities positioned incorrectly or outside visible range
1. **Extend timeline to full 24-hour range** by default - don't restrict to business hours
2. **Log position calculations**: pixel position, converted time, final placement
3. **Check time format consistency**: `scheduledTime` vs `time` field naming
4. **Add visual indicators** during drag to show exact drop position
5. **Test with current time** AND future times in different ranges

5. **FIND** working alternative from knowledge base or tools
6. **EXECUTE** working alternative in same message

## üïê DEVELOPMENT SERVER MONITORING PATTERNS

### Live Server Status Detection ‚úÖ
1. **Always add live timestamp indicators to test/development pages**
2. **Use `{currentTime.toLocaleTimeString()}` updating every 1000ms**
3. **Visual indicators**: Distinct color (cyan) + "Server Live" label
4. **Immediate diagnosis**: Timestamp stops = server stopped, timestamp behind = stale cache
5. **Prevention**: Eliminates time waste debugging "broken code" when server is actually stopped

### Server Restart Protocol ‚úÖ
1. **Check netstat**: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001` to find process
2. **Kill process**: `taskkill //F //PID [PID]` (double slashes for Git Bash)
3. **Build + Start**: `npm run build && npx next start -p 3001`
4. **Verify**: Check live timestamp is updating on test pages
5. **Never assume code is wrong** until server status is confirmed

## üêõ TIMELINE SYNCHRONIZATION BUG FIX PATTERN ‚úÖ

### Critical Timeline Drag Direction Bug (RESOLVED August 2, 2025)
**Problem**: Timeline visual position and time calculation were severely out of sync, showing wrong times (11+ hour offsets) when dragging timeline to center specific times.

**Root Cause Analysis**: The actual bug was NOT in the drag calculation sign, but in implementation differences between working and broken timelines:

1. **Working Timeline**: Uses fixed `4` pixels per minute
2. **Broken Timeline**: Uses variable `pixelsPerMinute` (4-8x zoom)
3. **Core Issue**: The mathematical relationships were correct, but coordinate system implementation needed proper adaptation from working code

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```typescript
// CORRECT coordinate system (timeline position calculation):
// position = -(time_in_minutes * pixelsPerMinute) + centerX + scrollOffset

// CORRECT drag calculation (confirmed working):
// minutesAtCenter = currentTimeMinutes - (scrollOffset / pixelsPerMinute)
```

**Fix Strategy**: 
1. **Adopt Working Logic**: Used exact positioning formula from working timeline
2. **Adapt for Zoom**: Replaced fixed `4` with variable `pixelsPerMinute` 
3. **Maintain Synchronization**: Ensured drag and position calculations use same conversion factor

**Testing Method**: 
1. Set timeline to 8am by dragging to center
2. Verify left panel shows 8am (not 6pm/7pm)
3. Test drag behavior: RIGHT = earlier times, LEFT = later times
4. Verify all zoom levels (4x-8x) maintain synchronization
5. Check DEBUG values match formatted display

**Key Insight**: User intuition expects: Drag RIGHT ‚Üí see earlier times, Drag LEFT ‚Üí see later times. The formula `currentTimeMinutes - (scrollOffset / pixelsPerMinute)` provides this relationship.

**Prevention**: 
1. Always copy EXACT working coordinate system before adapting for new features
2. Test UX direction BEFORE complex mathematical analysis
3. Use DEBUG displays to verify calculations match expectations
4. Test both edge cases and normal usage patterns

**Files Fixed**: `src/components/daily-use/GamelikeTimeline.tsx`
