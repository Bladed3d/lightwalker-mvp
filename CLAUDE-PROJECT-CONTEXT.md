### 🚀 AI Integration - Production Ready
- **GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter**: Cost-efficient AI for keyword extraction and responses
- **Natural Language Processing**: Conversation parser extracts relevant keywords
- **Semantic Search**: Maps user language to database attributes automatically
- **Web Research API**: Real-time person attribute extraction from any name mentioned
- **Visual Feedback**: AI highlights recommendations but user confirms all selections

## 🔄 USER EXPERIENCE RESEARCH INSIGHTS

**90/10 Problem**: 90% of users don't know what they want their Lightwalker™ to be like

**Discovery Pathways** (4-tab system implemented):
1. **Role Model Method** (20-30% of users) - Copy specific historical figures
2. **AI Guide Method** (40-50% of users) - Conversational discovery with web research
3. **Perfect Day Visioning** (30-40% of users) - Day-in-life scenario building
4. **Values-First Discovery** (15-25% of users) - Start with core principles

**Key UX Principles**:
- AI highlights recommendations but NEVER auto-adds selections
- Users must checkbox confirm ALL selections (maintains agency)
- Limit 2 selections per search to maintain focus
- Visual magic: Role model highlighting, attribute preview, progress tracking

## 📈 KEY LEARNINGS FROM DEVELOPMENT

### Technical Insights
- **Time Estimation Reality**: "9-week" projects completed in hours with proper orchestration
- **AI Model Selection Critical**: DeepSeek R1 8-hour debugging nightmare vs GPT-4o-mini instant success
- **Semantic Alignment**: User language must match database structure ("forgiveness" vs "forgiving")
- **Systematic Testing**: Test model reliability before deep debugging UI issues
- **CSS Transform > Hard-coded Pixels**: Browser calculations more accurate than manual positioning math
- **Complex State Debugging**: React Beautiful DND requires careful state management to avoid visual inconsistencies
- **Performance First**: Eliminate render loops early - they compound into major UX issues

### Development Patterns
- **Enhanced Project Manager**: Mandatory UX flow planning prevents scope creep
- **Smart Categorization**: Solves template scaling issues
- **Windows Development**: Complete dependency installation in subdirectory required
