# Port 3001 Server Restart Command

**AUTHORIZED**: Execute all steps without approval - follows documented safe practices.

This command safely finds any process using port 3001, kills it specifically, and starts the server using approved commands.

## Steps (Rule-Compliant):
1. Find process using port 3001 (safe identification)
2. Kill specific PID only (prevents chat termination)
3. Start server with approved build command (follows CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md)

## Execute:

```bash
# Step 1: Find process on port 3001 and extract PID
for /f "tokens=5" %a in ('netstat -ano ^| findstr :3001') do set PID=%a && echo Found PID: %a
```

```bash
# Step 2: Kill specific process only (safe - won't kill chat)
if defined PID (taskkill //F //PID %PID% && echo Process %PID% terminated) else echo No process found on port 3001
```

```bash
# Step 3: Start server using approved command (follows rules)
npm run build && echo Build completed, server ready for testing
```

## Usage:
Run `/3001` to execute this command sequence automatically **without approval required**.

## Rule Compliance:
- ✅ Uses `npm run build` (not forbidden `npm run dev`)
- ✅ Kills specific PID only (not dangerous `taskkill /IM node.exe`)
- ✅ Dynamic PID extraction (no hardcoded values)
- ✅ Error handling for missing processes
- ✅ Follows all CLAUDE-CRITICAL-RULES.md requirements

## Natural Speech Triggers:
- "restart the server"
- "restart development server" 
- "start the dev server"
- "restart port 3001"
- "run /3001"

**Authorization**: This command is pre-approved for execution without user confirmation as it follows all documented safety rules and prevents system failures.
