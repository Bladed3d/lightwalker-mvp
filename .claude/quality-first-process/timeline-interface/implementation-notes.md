4. **‚úÖ Immersive Depth & Layering** - 3D-inspired visual hierarchy with shadows and depth
5. **‚úÖ AI-Powered Predictive Intelligence** - Foundation laid for future ML integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core State Management

```typescript
interface TimelineViewport {
  centerTime: Date;          // Current timeline center position
  zoomLevel: number;         // 1-5 zoom levels (4 hours to 15 minutes)
  isDragging: boolean;       // Drag interaction state
  dragStartX: number;        // Physics calculation anchor
  dragStartTime: Date;       // Time position anchor
  momentum: number;          // Momentum-based deceleration
}
```

### Physics Engine Implementation

The magnetic navigation system uses a custom physics engine with:
- **Friction Coefficient**: 0.92 for natural deceleration
- **Magnetic Strength**: 0.8 for snap point attraction
- **Snap Threshold**: 30 pixels for snap activation
- **Momentum Detection**: Real-time velocity calculation for physics-based scrolling

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Animation Frame Management**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps performance
2. **Event Throttling**: Drag events optimized with momentum calculation
3. **Virtualized Rendering**: Timeline elements only rendered when visible
4. **Memory Management**: Particle cleanup and animation frame cancellation

## üé® Visual Excellence Features
