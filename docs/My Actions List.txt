My Actions List





Mindfulness & meditation

1) Live Truth First Protocol - every word, every deed, based on truth. Not ego.

2) You can be right or you can be happy. Choose. Ego or Joy.

3) Perspective is easily gained by asking, "In 200 years how will this matter?"

4) Thoughts are man talking to the Universe. Intuition is the Universe talking to man. 

5) Meditations is not thinking of nothing. It is the act of watching you mind think of one thing. And when that one thing is a deity, then miracles can happen. And when that one thing is your true self, time stops.

6) Be kind. Mostly to yourself.

7) Those who speak, don't know. Those who know, don't speak.

8) Self Talk. Be the coach you have always wanted.

*Course: Guided meditations (breath, creative, meeting, blessing, question)


Communication

1) Always get permission first, then coach or advise.

2) When tension rises or conflict appears, immediately switch from making statements to asking questions.

3) One of the most powerful tools in communication is silence. 

4) Before speaking, determine what you hope to accomplish. If it is your ego speaking, stop.



Learning

1) Throughout history, the most proven way to change (yourself or the world) is to read new thoughts. You learn and get inspired. It is the step before thought as you ride on the brilliant thoughts of others. Then you can have your own.

2) When you fail once, if you learn and solve it, you will never fail twice.

3) The fastest way to learn is by doing. Copy someone who knows and you get the same results without knowing. But by doing, you will come to know too.

4) "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change." - Stephen Hawking



Creativity

1) Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the
  entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution." (My thought: knowledge defines what we know. Imagination defines what we will know.)

2) Walking meetings meditation

3) You must allow your mind to go to take you to extreme heights, alternative views, and even crazy imaginations. Then when you come back to earth, you are likely to land on the top of a mountain.

4) When you want an answer, start writing. Start by writing your question. Then say, "If I did know the answer, what would I write..." and just start writing. Imagine and pretend you know and after 10 minutes of writing, you will begin to.

5) Strategic napping - using the Edison technique.

6) Artistic diversion: create music, art, pottery, and other artistic activities. It uses the brain differently which translates to other aspects of life.


Productivity

1) Imagineering. Spend time imagining a great idea, a perfect positive solution, or a creative alternative path. Give you mind permission to enjoy a playground of no rules, only possibilities and magic!

2) Focus on what you DO want, not what you DON'T want. \

3) Define Success by your process, not your outcome. The act of writing in your journal is what matters, not what you write. Some days will be enjoyable. Some days may be a struggle. But the ACT of writing in your journal is success. Same with everything. Just showing up is 90% of success.

4) Identify 10 projects. Then get rid of 7 of them. Focus on what matters most.

5) The greatest answers come from asking better questions.

6) A bumbling fool can create a complicated idea. It takes genius to simplify it.


Relationships & Social

1) Be a true friend: sharing their pain cuts it in half, sharing their joy doubles it.

2) Most conflicts in relationships arise from trying to change another. The truth is you can only change yourself.

3) Listen. No agenda, no ego. Just listen. Action: repeat their comments or summarize what they said so they feel heard.

4) Be vulnerable and authentic. With consideration and sensitivity, when others are struggling, share your similar experiences and how you overcame... or even how you still struggle.

Mindfulness

“It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.”

—Theodore Roosevelt
