create images at gemini.google.com
Prompt:
Please research Leonardo da Vinci to determine what they are most famous for and then Please create a watercolor painting, head shot of them which depicts that which is famous for, in the style of painting, bold colors, HDR, ratio 1:1 -no graphics over face

to see what names in role model images do the following:
1. Open the browser console at
  https://lightwalker-mvp.vercel.app/gamified-simple
  2. Look for the log message "ðŸ“· Expected image filenames:"
  3. You'll see exactly what each role model expects, like:
    - Isaac Newton â†’ /role-models/isaac-newton.jpg
    - Steve Jobs â†’ /role-models/steve-jobs.jpg
    - etc.

  Then just name your image files to match exactly what's shown in the
  console!


Hi Claude! Before working on any AI issues, please:

  1. Read docs/Claude-Problem-Solving-Playbook.md
  2. Follow the systematic debugging methodology in CLAUDE.md
  3. Use src/app/api/test-llm-reliability to test models before debugging
  4. Remember: We spent 8 hours debugging DeepSeek R1 when the real issues were model reliability + semantic mismatches     

  Key insight: Always check both technical issues AND semantic alignment between user language and database structure.

Cool dashboard to make better when we have users: http://localhost:3001/udis-dashboard

I will research more about this later:
Want to try something concrete? We could build a simple "AI App Observer" that:
  1. Watches user behavior on your Lightwalker app
  2. Identifies friction points
  3. Suggests specific improvements
  4. Even better - implements A/B tests automatically
