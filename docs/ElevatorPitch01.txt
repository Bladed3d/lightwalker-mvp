When there is interest, continue the conversation with:
We are working on a collaboration tool that removes executive attitude and ego and drives innovation an estimated 1264%. 

(If asked How? By creating a "Holo-deck" where each executive is represented by their AI assistant. During collaboration, each department doesn't know if an idea or solution came from that department head or the AI inter-departmental analysis. So everyone is more interested in keeping up with the best solution, not ego posturing for credit.)

The #1 killer of innovation is executive ego. Our collaboration platform lets department heads contribute ideas through AI proxies, so solutions are judged purely on merit, not politics. McKinsey's research shows ego-driven decisions cost companies 43% in lost innovation—we flip that into pure competitive advantage.
