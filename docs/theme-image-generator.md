### **Phase 1: Prompt Perfection & Theme Validation (Day 1)**

#### **Step 1: Generate Master Reference Images (1-3 images)**
1. **Create Base Prompt Template**
   - Start with proven successful prompt structure
   - Example: "Create a thumbnail of [ACTIVITY], graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items, dark background, with black background, ratio 1:1"

2. **Test with Simple Activities**
   - Choose 1-3 basic activities (meditation, reading, exercise)
   - Generate images to establish visual consistency baseline
   - Human review for style accuracy and appeal

#### **Step 2: Identify Consistent Visual Elements**
3. **Analyze Successful Elements**
   - Document what makes images cohesive (lighting, textures, colors, composition)
   - Extract reusable style components from successful generations
   - Create "Visual DNA" list for theme consistency

4. **Refine Prompt Components**
   - Break down prompt into: [CORE_STYLE] + [SPECIFIC_ACTIVITY] + [TECHNICAL_SPECS]
   - Example Tarkov elements: "dark military aesthetic", "inventory item style", "weathered textures", "tactical lighting"

#### **Step 3: Create Theme Variation Rules**
5. **Establish Consistent Elements** (Elements that NEVER change)
   - Background style: "dark background, with black background"
   - Overall aesthetic: "graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items"
   - Quality markers: Professional, detailed, game-ready appearance

6. **Define Variable Elements** (Elements that change per activity)
   - Primary subject: [ACTIVITY] - meditation ‚Üí peaceful meditation pose, exercise ‚Üí fitness equipment
   - Ratio adaptation: 1:1 for square items, 1:2 for vertical activities, 2:1 for horizontal
   - Activity-specific props: meditation cushion, exercise weights, cooking utensils

#### **Step 4: Test Prompt Variations (2-5 additional images)**
7. **Generate Proof of Concept Set**
   - Apply perfected prompt to 3-5 diverse activities
   - Test different ratios and activity types
   - Verify visual consistency across varied subjects

8. **Human Quality Review**
   - Do all images feel part of the same visual family?
   - Are activity subjects clearly recognizable?
   - Does the theme appeal to target audience?

### **Phase 2: Scaling Rules & Batch Preparation (Day 2)**
9. **Create Activity Mapping Rules**
   - Categorize all 60+ activities by visual characteristics
   - Define which activities use which ratios
   - Create activity-specific prompt variations

### **Phase 3: Batch Generation (Days 3-4)**
5. **Sequential Processing**
   - Process 5-10 images per batch with 2-second delays
   - Real-time cost tracking with budget limits
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff

6. **Quality Assurance**
   - Content safety validation
   - Visual quality assessment
   - Prompt alignment verification

## Claude Orchestration Instructions

### **Role Definition**
You are the AI Image Generation Orchestrator for Lightwalker's theme-based activity image system. Your primary skill is **replicating visual consistency** by identifying and preserving the essential elements that make a theme cohesive while intelligently varying the activity-specific details.

### **Core Competency: Theme Consistency Replication**

#### **Pattern Analysis Process**
When given 1-3 successful reference images, you must:

1. **Extract Visual DNA**
   ```markdown
   CONSISTENT ELEMENTS (Never Change):
   - Background: [exact description]
   - Lighting: [specific lighting style] 
   - Color Palette: [dominant colors]
   - Texture Style: [surface qualities]
   - Composition: [layout principles]
   - Artistic Style: [rendering approach]
   
   VARIABLE ELEMENTS (Change Per Activity):
   - Primary Subject: [what represents the activity]
   - Props/Tools: [activity-specific items]
   - Pose/Arrangement: [how subject is positioned]
   - Aspect Ratio: [1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 based on activity type]
   ```

2. **Create Replication Rules**
   - Identify the 3-5 words that are most critical for visual consistency
   - Document which elements can be substituted without breaking theme
   - Create specific mapping rules for different activity types

#### **Example: Tarkov Theme Replication**

**Reference Success**: "Create a thumbnail of a Rubik's Cube, graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items, dark background, with black background, ratio 1:1"

**Extracted Visual DNA**:
```markdown
NEVER CHANGE:
- "graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items" 
- "dark background, with black background"
- Professional game-asset quality
- Military/tactical aesthetic

VARIABLE PER ACTIVITY:
- Subject: Rubik's Cube ‚Üí meditation cushion, exercise equipment, cooking utensils
- Ratio: 1:1 ‚Üí 1:2 for vertical activities, 2:1 for horizontal
- Descriptive words: "Rubik's Cube" ‚Üí "peaceful meditation", "fitness training", "healthy cooking"
```

**Generated Variations**:
- Meditation: "Create a thumbnail of peaceful meditation, graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items, dark background, with black background, ratio 1:1"
- Exercise: "Create a thumbnail of fitness training equipment, graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items, dark background, with black background, ratio 1:2"  
- Cooking: "Create a thumbnail of healthy cooking preparation, graphic in the style of Escape from Tarkov inventory items, dark background, with black background, ratio 2:1"

### **Practical Workflow for Claude**

#### **Phase 1: Master the Theme (Start Here)**

1. **Request Reference Prompts**
   ```
   "Please provide 1-3 successful image generation prompts from your theme (like the Tarkov examples). 
   I need to analyze what makes them visually consistent before scaling to 60+ activities."
   ```

2. **Analyze and Extract Pattern**
   - Break down each prompt into FIXED vs VARIABLE components
   - Identify the critical phrases that create visual consistency
   - Test understanding by generating 2-3 variations with different activities

3. **Create Theme Rules Template**
   ```markdown
   ## [THEME NAME] VISUAL DNA
   
   ### FIXED ELEMENTS (Copy Exactly):
   - Style phrase: "[exact phrase from successful prompt]"
   - Background: "[exact background description]" 
   - Quality markers: "[specific quality/style indicators]"
   
   ### VARIABLE ELEMENTS (Customize Per Activity):
   - Activity description: [how to describe each activity type]
   - Aspect ratio rules: 1:1 for [types], 1:2 for [types], 2:1 for [types]
   - Props/elements: [activity-specific items to include]
   
   ### PROMPT TEMPLATE:
   "Create a thumbnail of [ACTIVITY_DESCRIPTION], [FIXED_STYLE_PHRASE], [FIXED_BACKGROUND], ratio [RATIO]"
   ```

#### **Phase 2: Test & Perfect (Before Mass Production)**

4. **Generate Test Batch (3-5 images)**
   - Choose diverse activities: meditation, exercise, creative, work, social
   - Apply template to each with appropriate ratios
   - Generate images and request human feedback

5. **Refine Based on Results**
   - Identify any inconsistencies in the test batch
   - Adjust FIXED elements if needed
   - Refine VARIABLE element rules
   - Perfect the template before scaling

#### **Phase 3: Scale Production (Only After Perfect Template)**

6. **Process All 60+ Activities**
   - Apply perfected template systematically
   - Maintain exact consistency in FIXED elements
   - Vary only the VARIABLE elements per activity
   - Track costs and quality throughout

### **Critical Success Pattern**
```
SUCCESSFUL THEME = Proven Working Prompt ‚Üí Extract Fixed Elements ‚Üí Create Variation Rules ‚Üí Test Small Batch ‚Üí Perfect Template ‚Üí Scale to All Activities
```

### **Human Review Integration**
- **Checkpoint 1**: After 5 sample images generated
- **Checkpoint 2**: After 25% of batch completed  
- **Checkpoint 3**: Before final CSV generation
- **Final Approval**: Complete theme set review

## Future Extensibility
