- **Locking Mechanism**: Important traits can be pinned/protected
- **Nested Containers**: Role models contain specific attribute sets

**Applied to Lightwalker Daily Use**:
```
[Einstein Container - Active] 📘
├── Curiosity ⚡ → "Ask 3 Why Questions" (Current Activity)
├── Focus 🎯 → "2-hour Deep Work Block" (Scheduled 2pm)
└── Logic 🔬 → "Problem Analysis Session" (Evening)

[Gandhi Container] 🕊️
├── Patience 🌱 → "10-minute Breathing Space"
├── Justice ⚖️ → "Community Service Planning"
└── Simplicity 🤲 → "Minimal Living Review"
```

**Visual Design Elements**:
- **Attribute Icons**: Consistent iconography for each personality trait
- **Activity Indicators**: Current (🔴 LIVE), upcoming (🟡), completed (🟢)
- **Connection Lines**: Visual links between attributes and specific actions
- **Influence Meters**: Show which role models are most active today

### Skill Tree Patterns for Personality Development

### Multi-Role Model Visual Representation

**Lightwalker-Specific Challenge**: Show influence of 3-5 role models simultaneously

**Visual Solutions Researched**:
1. **Layered Influence System**: Primary role model (70% opacity) with secondary influences (30%)
2. **Rotating Focus**: Active role model prominent, others shown as smaller icons
3. **Blend Visualization**: Character appearance combines visual elements from all selected models
4. **Activity-Based Switching**: Role model prominence changes based on current activity type

**Recommended Approach**:
```
[Main Character Display]
├── Primary: Einstein (currently active) - 60% influence
├── Secondary: Gandhi (values overlay) - 25% influence
├── Tertiary: Joan of Arc (courage boost) - 15% influence
└── Animation: Character reading (Einstein activity) with peaceful expression (Gandhi) and confident posture (Joan)
