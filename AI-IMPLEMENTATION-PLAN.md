# AI Implementation Plan - Lightwalkerâ„¢ Character Creation

## Phase 1: MVP with Cost-Effective AI (Current Sprint)

### **AI Provider Strategy**
- âœ… **Primary AI**: Kimi K2 via Openrouter
- **Reasoning**: Cost-effective for simple parsing tasks, adequate for MVP
- **Use Cases**: Keyword extraction, basic conversation flow, template responses
- **Cost Estimate**: ~90% savings vs GPT-4 for routine interactions

### **Core AI Tasks (Phase 1)**
```javascript
// Simple tasks perfect for Kimi K2
const phase1Tasks = {
  keywordExtraction: "Extract 1-2 key terms from user input",
  synonymMapping: "Expand focus â†’ [focus, concentration, attention, strategic]", 
  templateResponses: "I found something perfect for you! I've highlighted...",
  basicValidation: "Detect if user input is coherent vs gibberish",
  searchTriggering: "Convert natural language â†’ database search terms"
}
```

### **Implementation Architecture**
```
User Input â†’ Kimi K2 (Openrouter) â†’ Parsed Keywords â†’ Database Search â†’ UI Highlights
```

## Phase 2: Progressive AI System (Post-MVP)

### **Tiered AI Strategy**
```
Tier 1 (Kimi K2): Routine interactions (95% of use cases)
â”œâ”€â”€ Keyword extraction from user descriptions
â”œâ”€â”€ Template-based responses and explanations  
â”œâ”€â”€ Simple attribute matching and recommendations
â””â”€â”€ Basic conversation flow management

Tier 2 (Premium AI): Complex reasoning (5% of use cases)
â”œâ”€â”€ User frustration/confusion handling
â”œâ”€â”€ Nuanced personality synthesis discussions
â”œâ”€â”€ Custom Daily-Do item creation
â”œâ”€â”€ Deep philosophical conversations about values
â””â”€â”€ Multi-turn complex problem solving
```

### **Escalation Triggers**
```javascript
const escalationTriggers = {
  frustrationPhrases: [
    "you don't understand",
    "that's not what I meant",
    "this isn't helpful", 
    "you're missing the point",
    "that doesn't make sense"
  ],
  
  complexityIndicators: [
    "it's complicated because...",
    "the real issue is...", 
    "what I really mean is...",
    conversationLength > 5_turns,
    multipleBackAndForth: true
  ],
  
  userRequestsUpgrade: [
    "can you be smarter",
    "think harder about this",
    "give me a better answer"
  ]
}
```

### **Cost Management**
```
Expected Usage Distribution:
â”œâ”€â”€ 95% interactions: Kimi K2 ($0.02/1K tokens)
â”œâ”€â”€ 5% escalations: GPT-4 ($0.30/1K tokens)  
â””â”€â”€ Overall cost reduction: ~85% vs all-premium approach

Monthly Cost Estimate (1000 active users):
â”œâ”€â”€ Phase 1 (Kimi K2 only): ~$50/month
â”œâ”€â”€ Phase 2 (Tiered): ~$120/month
â””â”€â”€ All-Premium approach: ~$800/month
```

## User Experience Design

### **Phase 1 UX Flow**
```
1. Opening Question (Template + Kimi K2 personalization)
   "What feels most natural for you to think about:
   ðŸŽ¯ Challenges you face (distraction, overwhelm, anger)
   âœ¨ Strengths you want (focus, patience, confidence)" 

2. AI Processing (Kimi K2)
   Input: "I have trouble focusing at work"
   Output: keywords=['focus', 'work', 'concentration']
   
3. Visual Magic (No AI needed)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Database search using extracted keywords
   â”œâ”€â”€ Steve Jobs Strategic Focus highlighted
   â”œâ”€â”€ Right panel shows attribute preview
   â””â”€â”€ User confirms with checkbox

4. AI Response (Template + personalization)
   "I found something perfect for you! I've highlighted Steve Jobs' 
   Strategic Focus approach - he has this powerful method where..."
```

### **Seamless Escalation (Phase 2)**
```
User: "You don't understand, my focus problem is more complex..."

System Response:
â”œâ”€â”€ Detect frustration trigger
â”œâ”€â”€ Switch to premium AI seamlessly  
â”œâ”€â”€ User message: "Let me think more deeply about this..."
â”œâ”€â”€ Premium AI provides nuanced response
â””â”€â”€ Continue conversation with enhanced intelligence
```

## Technical Implementation

### **Phase 1 API Integration**
```typescript
// Simple Openrouter integration for Kimi K2
const parseUserInput = async (userMessage: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku',  // Cost-effective option
      messages: [{
        role: 'user',
        content: `Extract 1-2 key terms from: "${userMessage}". 
                 Focus on problems (distraction, anger) or desired traits (focus, patience).
                 Return as JSON: {"keywords": ["focus", "work"]}`
      }]
    })
  })
  return response.json()
}
```

### **Phase 2 Escalation System**
```typescript
class AIOrchestrator {
  private async detectEscalation(userMessage: string, conversationHistory: Message[]): Promise<boolean> {
    // Check for frustration triggers
    const frustrationScore = this.calculateFrustrationScore(userMessage)
    const complexityScore = this.calculateComplexityScore(conversationHistory) 
    
    return frustrationScore > 0.7 || complexityScore > 0.8
  }
  
  private async handleEscalation(userMessage: string): Promise<string> {
    // Switch to premium AI with context
    return await this.callPremiumAI(userMessage, "user_needs_enhanced_understanding")
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 KPIs**
- âœ… Cost per interaction < $0.05
- âœ… Keyword extraction accuracy > 85%
- âœ… User completion rate > 70% 
- âœ… Time to first attribute selection < 2 minutes

### **Phase 2 KPIs**  
- âœ… Escalation rate < 10% of conversations
- âœ… User satisfaction post-escalation > 90%
- âœ… Overall cost reduction > 80% vs all-premium
- âœ… Complex problem resolution rate > 85%

## Risk Mitigation

### **Phase 1 Risks**
- **Kimi K2 inadequacy**: Conservative triggers for escalation even in Phase 1
- **User frustration**: Clear messaging about AI assistance + human-like responses
- **Cost overrun**: Usage monitoring and alerts

### **Phase 2 Risks**
- **Escalation sensitivity**: A/B testing of trigger thresholds
- **Context loss**: Maintain conversation history across AI tier switches
- **User awareness**: Seamless switching - user never knows which AI they're using

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Kimi K2 integration + basic keyword extraction
- **Week 2**: UI integration + visual feedback system  
- **Week 3**: Pre-beta testing + refinement
- **Week 4**: Phase 2 planning + escalation system design
- **Month 2**: Progressive AI implementation + production deployment
